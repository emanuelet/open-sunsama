# Desktop Releases

Guide for building and releasing the Open Sunsama desktop app across all platforms.

---

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| **Release** | `bun run release` (patch), `bun run release minor`, or `bun run release 1.2.3` |
| **Rebuild a version** | GitHub → Actions → Desktop Release → Run workflow → version `1.x.x` |
| **Re-run one platform** | Open the failed run → **Re-run failed jobs** (the API upserts, so re-runs are safe) |
| **Check Status** | https://github.com/ShadowWalker2014/open-sunsama/actions/workflows/desktop-release.yml |
| **Downloads Page** | https://opensunsama.com/download |

## Release Workflow

From a clean, up-to-date `main`:

```bash
bun run release
```

`scripts/release.mjs` bumps the root version, runs `version:sync`, updates `AGENTS.md`, and opens a `release: vX.Y.Z` PR (main requires CI, so nothing is pushed to main directly). It waits for CI, merges the PR, then tags the merge commit and pushes the tag. The tag push starts the workflow, which:

1. Builds each platform in parallel (about 15 minutes, 60-minute timeout per job)
2. Uploads the installer, updater file and signature to S3
3. Registers each platform with `POST /releases` (upsert)
4. Runs a `verify` job that fails unless all four platforms serve the new version and each download returns HTTP 200

### Why the builds are fast

- **The desktop app ships without marketing images.** `apps/desktop/scripts/prepare-frontend.mjs` copies `apps/web/dist` to `apps/desktop/dist` without `blog-*`, `landing/` and `og-image.png` (about 570 MB). The desktop app redirects `/` to `/app` or `/login`, so it never shows those pages.
- **Each platform builds only the package it ships:** `app,dmg` on macOS, `appimage` on Linux, `nsis` on Windows. The unused Linux `.rpm` used to take 5 hours.
- **Rust builds are cached** with `Swatinem/rust-cache`.

**macOS updater files get arch-specific names.** Tauri names both Mac updaters `Open Sunsama.app.tar.gz`, so the workflow uploads them as `Open Sunsama_<version>_macos-arm64.app.tar.gz` and `..._macos-x64.app.tar.gz`. Before this, the second Mac build overwrote the first, and one architecture's auto-update failed its signature check.

## Build Outputs

| Platform | Architecture | File Type | Location |
|----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| macOS | Apple Silicon (arm64) | `.dmg` | `releases/v{version}/` |
| macOS | Intel (x64) | `.dmg` | `releases/v{version}/` |
| Windows | x64 | `.exe` (NSIS) | `releases/v{version}/` |
| Linux | x64 | `.AppImage` | `releases/v{version}/` |

## Required Secrets

### GitHub Repository Secrets

Location: **Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME` | Railway S3 bucket name |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | S3 access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | S3 secret key |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | Railway S3 endpoint |
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | S3 region (e.g., `us-east-1`) |
| `RELEASE_SECRET` | API auth for registering releases |

### Railway API Environment Variables

Location: **Railway → API Service → Variables**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RELEASE_SECRET` | Must match GitHub secret |

### Generate RELEASE_SECRET

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/releases` | GET | Public | List all releases |
| `/releases/latest` | GET | Public | Latest release per platform |
| `/releases/:platform` | GET | Public | Latest for specific platform |
| `/releases` | POST | `X-Release-Secret` | Register new release (CI only) |

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error
2. Common issues:
   - Missing secrets → Add in GitHub Settings
   - Rust toolchain issues → Usually auto-resolves on retry
   - Code signing (macOS) → Not configured, builds are unsigned

### Release Not Showing on Downloads Page

1. Verify workflow completed successfully
2. Check API logs for registration errors
3. Verify `RELEASE_SECRET` matches in GitHub and Railway
4. Test API: `curl https://api.opensunsama.com/releases/latest`

### S3 Upload Failed

1. Verify all AWS_* secrets are set correctly
2. Check bucket permissions allow uploads
3. Verify endpoint URL is correct for Railway S3

## Local Development Build

```bash
# Build web app first
cd apps/web && bun run build

# Build desktop (current platform only)
cd apps/desktop && bun run tauri build

# Output location
# macOS: apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/
# Windows: apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/
# Linux: apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/
```

## Workflow File

Location: `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`

Triggers:
- Push tags matching `v*`
- Manual workflow dispatch

Matrix builds:
- `macos-latest` (builds both arm64 and x64)
- `ubuntu-22.04` (Linux)
- `windows-latest` (Windows)
