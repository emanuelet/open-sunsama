# Open Sunsama

### Daily planning, done right.

The open-source daily planner for time-blocking, focused work, and seamless AI integration.<br />
**AI native:** control it from any agent, including **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, Cursor, Claude Code, or any MCP client, with one URL and no API key.

## ✨ Why Open Sunsama

Most planners are closed boxes that your AI assistant can't see into. Open Sunsama is built to be driven by AI as much as by you:

- **🤖 Your AI plans with you.** Claude and ChatGPT can read your schedule, create and prioritize tasks, time-block your day, and close things out through a secure one-click connector.
- **🗓️ Sunsama-style daily planning.** A kanban board of days, drag-and-drop time blocking, focus mode with a timer, and rollover of unfinished work.
- **🔓 Open source and self-hostable.** Run it on your own server, read every line, and extend it through a full REST API.
- **🖥️ Everywhere you work.** Web, desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux), and mobile, with light and dark themes and keyboard-first navigation.

<br />

**Coding assistants** connect the same way:

| Client | Install |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add --transport http open-sunsama https://api.opensunsama.com/mcp`, then run `/mcp` → Authenticate |
| **Cursor** | [![Add to Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=open-sunsama&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5vcGVuc3Vuc2FtYS5jb20vbWNwIn0=) |
| **VS Code** | [![Add to VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Add_MCP_server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=open-sunsama&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22http%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A//api.opensunsama.com/mcp%22%7D) |
| **Any MCP client** | Add the URL as a Streamable HTTP server with OAuth |

Then just ask:

> *"What's on my plate today? Move anything that isn't a P0 or P1 to tomorrow."*<br />
> *"Block 9–11am tomorrow for deep work on the launch plan and link it to that task."*<br />
> *"Add subtasks to 'Board deck': metrics slide, roadmap slide, asks."*

<details>
<summary><b>How the connection stays secure</b></summary>

<br />

- **Standard OAuth 2.1 with PKCE.** Claude and ChatGPT are identified by their published client metadata (CIMD), so the consent screen shows a **verified** badge. Other clients register with dynamic client registration.
- **Scoped, short-lived tokens.** Access tokens expire hourly and refresh automatically. Refresh tokens rotate, and replaying an old one revokes the whole grant.
- **Least privilege.** Connector tokens only reach tasks, time blocks, and your profile. They can't touch API keys, passwords, uploads, or calendar accounts.
- **Annotated tools.** Every tool is marked read-only or destructive, so assistants ask before deleting anything.
- **One-click disconnect** under **Settings → MCP → Connected apps**.

## 👥 Built for people who plan their day

- **Founders and managers** juggling roadmaps, 1:1s, hiring, and customer calls, who want one place to decide what matters today.
- **Engineers** who live in [Cursor, Claude Code, and the terminal](https://opensunsama.com/for/developers) and want their planner reachable from there.
- **Remote and async teams** [time-blocking across time zones](https://opensunsama.com/for/remote-workers).
- **ADHD and neurodivergent planners** who need [structure, visual time, and gentle rollover](https://opensunsama.com/for/adhd) instead of guilt.
- **Privacy-minded teams** who want to self-host their planner and keep data on their own servers.

<br />

## 🛠️ MCP tools

```

Scopes: `tasks:read` `tasks:write` `time-blocks:read` `time-blocks:write` `ideas:read` `ideas:write` `user:read` `user:write`. See the [API reference](https://opensunsama.com/docs/api/authentication).

<br />

## 🚀 Get started

**Cloud:** create an account at [opensunsama.com](https://opensunsama.com), then [connect your AI](#-connect-claude-or-chatgpt-in-30-seconds).

**Self-host with Docker:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadowWalker2014/open-sunsama.git
cd open-sunsama
docker compose up -d --build   # PostgreSQL, Redis, API on :3001, web app on :3000
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and create your account. The API creates the database tables on start, and the MCP connector is at http://localhost:3001/mcp. The [self-hosting guide](https://opensunsama.com/docs/self-hosting/docker) covers running on a server with your own domain, optional integrations, and backups. The desktop and mobile apps connect only to opensunsama.com, so self-hosters use the web app.

<details>
<summary><b>Run from source</b></summary>

<br />

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4.2 (run `mise install` when using mise) and PostgreSQL 15+ (Homebrew's `postgresql@17`, or a hosted database such as Neon or Supabase). S3-compatible storage is optional, for file uploads.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadowWalker2014/open-sunsama.git
cd open-sunsama
mise install
bun install

# API on :3001 and web app on :3000. Tables are created on start;
# Redis, email, background jobs and OAuth stay off.
DEV_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/opensunsama bun run dev:local
```

To run with integrations turned on, copy `apps/api/.env.example` to `apps/api/.env`, fill it in, and use `bun run dev`.

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Web app | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:3001 |
| MCP connector | http://localhost:3001/mcp |
| Drizzle Studio | http://localhost:4983 |

For calendar sync, follow the [Google Calendar setup guide](docs/calendar/google-calendar-setup.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Seed a demo workspace</b></summary>

<br />

`scripts/readme-media/seed-demo.ts` fills an account with a realistic week (tasks, subtasks, time blocks, and ideas) through the REST API. It's the same data behind these screenshots:

```bash
DEMO_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 DEMO_PASSWORD='Choose-a-strong-1' bun run scripts/readme-media/seed-demo.ts
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>What is Open Sunsama?</b></summary>
<br />
An open-source daily planner and task manager inspired by Sunsama. You plan each day on a kanban board, time-block tasks on a calendar, and work through them in focus mode. It's also an MCP server, so AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT can manage your tasks and schedule for you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it an open-source Sunsama alternative?</b></summary>
<br />
Yes. It covers Sunsama's daily-planning loop (a kanban board, time blocking, focus mode, and calendar sync), the code is on GitHub, and you can self-host it. On top of that, any AI agent can run it over MCP. See <a href="#-license">License</a> for the terms.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I connect it to ChatGPT or Claude?</b></summary>
<br />
Add <code>https://api.opensunsama.com/mcp</code> as a custom connector in Claude, or as a plugin connection in ChatGPT's developer mode. Then sign in and click <b>Allow access</b>. Step-by-step guides: <a href="https://opensunsama.com/docs/mcp/claude">Claude</a> and <a href="https://opensunsama.com/docs/mcp/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is MCP?</b></summary>
<br />
The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">Model Context Protocol</a> is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to tools and data. Open Sunsama's MCP server gives assistants 24 tools to read and update your tasks, subtasks, and time blocks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can my AI delete my tasks without asking?</b></summary>
<br />
Destructive tools are annotated as such, so Claude and ChatGPT ask for confirmation before running them. You can revoke an assistant's access at any time under Settings → MCP.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work with Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Code?</b></summary>
<br />
Yes. Use the one-click buttons above for Cursor and VS Code, or run <code>claude mcp add --transport http open-sunsama https://api.opensunsama.com/mcp</code> for Claude Code.
</details>
