/**
 * Per-render coalescing batcher for `GET /tasks/:id/subtasks`.
 *
 * The kanban renders dozens of `<TaskCard>` components at once, each calling
 * `useSubtasks(task.id)`. Without this, every card fires its own roundtrip
 * — 30+ requests fan out and Tiptap, the editor chunk, and the kanban data
 * all get queued behind them on the same connection. We instead funnel
 * those reads into a single `POST /tasks/subtasks-batch` request and feed
 * each `useSubtasks(taskId)` caller's queryFn promise the right slice.
 *
 * Coalescing window: a microtask. Anything that registers within the same
 * synchronous render pass (or React Query refetch tick) joins the same
 * batch.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - We do NOT short-circuit on cached data. React Query already skips
 *   `queryFn` entirely when cached data is fresh (within staleTime), and
 *   when it doesn't skip — e.g. the WebSocket layer just invalidated the
 *   query for a cross-device update — we want a real network fetch.
 * - We do NOT call `queryClient.setQueryData` from the batch resolution.
 *   Doing so races with optimistic mutations: a mutation's `onMutate`
 *   calls `cancelQueries(...)` which signals queries to ignore their
 *   in-flight result, but a direct `setQueryData` write bypasses that
 *   guard and clobbers the optimistic snapshot. Resolving the per-entry
 *   promises is enough — React Query takes care of writing the cache for
 *   each subscriber that's still active.
